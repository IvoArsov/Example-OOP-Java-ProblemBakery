In your bakery, there are three types of bread sold: 
 	-> Rye Bread (RB) – £1.3 ,
 	-> Multiseeds bread (MB) - £1.2 and 
 	-> Brown bread (BB) - £1. 
Each bread has predefined price, amount sold and name (the abbreviations).
The person holds 2 data fields:
	the type of the bread bought (the abbreviations)
	the money they have
 You need to write a program:
1)	That calculates the total earning of each type of bread;
2)	That calculates your total earnings;
3)	That shows a person, who has a definite amount of money, how much of a particular type of bread may buy.
